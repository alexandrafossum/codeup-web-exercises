                <p><em>"I mean, because we are members of the Protestant Reformed Church,</em> which successfully challenged
                    the autocratic power of the Papacy in the mid-sixteenth century, we can wear little rubber devices
                    to prevent issue."</p>
                    <p> "Well, er, yes Mr. Anchovy, but you see your report here says that you are
                    an extremely dull person. You see, our experts describe you as an appallingly dull fellow,
                    unimaginative, timid, lacking in initiative, spineless, easily dominated, no sense of humour,
                    tedious company and irrepressibly drab and awful. And whereas in most professions these would be
                    considerable drawbacks, in chartered accountancy, they're a positive boon. That's what being a
                    Protestant's all about. That's why it's the church for me. That's why it's the church for anyone who
                    respects the individual and the individual's right to decide for him or herself. When Martin Luther
                    nailed his protest up to the church door in fifteen-seventeen, he may not have realised the full
                    significance of what he was doing, but four hundred years later, thanks to him, my dear, I can wear
                    whatever I want on my John Thomas..."</p>
                    <p> "It's not pining, it's passed on! This parrot is no more!
                    It has ceased to be! It's expired and gone to meet its maker! This is a late parrot! It's a stiff!
                    Bereft of life, it rests in peace! If you hadn't nailed it to the perch, it would be pushing up the
                    daisies! It's metabolic processes are now history! He's off the twig! He's kicked the bucket, he's
                    shuffled off the mortal coil, rung down the curtain and joined the choir invisible. This is an
                    ex-parrot! At this time, a friend shall lose his friend's hammer and the young shall not know where
                    lieth the things possessed by their fathers that their fathers put there only just the night before,
                    about eight o'clock."</p>
