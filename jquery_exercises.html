    <p>You don't frighten us, English pig dogs. Go and boil your bottoms,
        you sons of a silly person. I blow my nose at you, so-called
        "Arthur King," you and all your silly English K-nig-hts.</p>
    <p>What is the capital of Assyria? Oh, king eh? Very nice. And how'd
        you get that, eh? By exploiting the workers. By hanging on to
        outdated imperialist dogma which perpetuates the economic and
        social differences in our society. Listen, strange women lyin'
        in ponds distributin' swords is no basis for a system of
        government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from
        the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony. Come and
        see the violence inherent in the system. Help! Help! I'm being
        repressed!</p>
    <p>Are you suggesting coconuts migrate? What is the capital of Assyria?
        Oh, king eh? Very nice. And how'd you get that, eh? By exploiting
        the workers. By hanging on to outdated imperialist dogma which
        perpetuates the economic and social differences in our society. Oh,
        oh, I see! Running away, eh? You yellow bastards! Come back here and
        take what's coming to you! I'll bite your legs off! The Lady of the
        Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite held aloft
        Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine
        providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. THAT is why I am
        your king.</p>
